- DictStyleDet..detect lex entries (currently only growth) in 5000 lemmatized files
- results in checklex in dropbox --> results
- to compare with Reco (manually annotated by Cedric) and LM_GI xls (Algo of Cedric)
-- ReadReco.java reads the Reco file and splits to get the reco label and dumps sentences for a given reco style in a temp outfile file
-- use this output file to compare with CheckLex
--> all the growth reco annotated by Cedric detected by DictStyle (checklex)

- to also check our lexmatch in checklest: are all the detected sentence really about growth? use grep/tail etc
